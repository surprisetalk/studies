# INGREDIENTS AS FIRST-ORDER VARIABLES

Run a series of tests to create a 6D bread matrix -- use photo documentation.

Experiments should be half-loaves.

- water :       500g :       250g -      1000g : standard dist
- flour :       360g :       180g -       720g : standard dist
- salt  :      5.25g :       2.5g -        10g : standard dist
- yeast :         1g :       0.5g -         2g : standard dist
- temp  : 45min@475C : 90min@150C - 20min@260C : linear
- time  :         7h :         0h -        24h : log


# INGREDIENTS AS SECOND-ORDER VARIABLES

After getting a feel for what the first-order effects, try messing with variables that change over time, such as agitation, folding, lid-baking etc.

# CULTURING YEAST

Figure out how to make my own levain or whatever it's called.
